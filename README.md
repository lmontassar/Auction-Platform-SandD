# SOUQ AND DALLEL - Auction Web and Mobile Platform

## üìñ About The Project

SOUQ AND DALLEL is a comprehensive web and mobile application designed to modernize the auction process. This platform creates a secure, transparent, and efficient digital ecosystem connecting sellers, buyers, commissioners, and transporters. 

The primary goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional auction systems, such as a lack of transparency and complex logistics. The application provides a complete solution that simplifies transactions, enhances the user experience, and integrates advanced features like secure payments, real-time notifications, and delivery tracking.

The project was developed using the

**Agile Scrum methodology** for iterative and flexible progress, and **UML diagrams** were used for system modeling.
